# Arduino-Uno-Water-Heater-Thermostat-for-PWM-pumps
There are hundreds of homemade thermostats with various MCU and sensors. Some are very simple, others are very sophisticated. However I decided to build my own thermostat especially for a solar panel and a new generation high efficiency PWM pumps. Moreover this thermostat offers:
-	Cost less than 20â‚¬, all included, by the use of very low cost components like the Arduino Uno R3, and two waterproof DS18B20, and a SSR
-	Can be use with any kind of water boiler and any kind of pump:
o	Regular pump or Pressure regulated high-efficiency pump
o	High-efficiency pump with a PWM profile for a rising characteristic curve
o	High-efficiency pump with a PWM profile for a falling characteristic curve
-	All parameters can be easily set and recovered after a restart,
-	Can be built by any beginner in soldering some electronic components
This manual explains step by step how to build this device, with an Arduino Uno rev.3.
